# classic-snake

*this is a fork of https://github.com/CodingWith-Adam/snake

The classic snake game from old school bar-style phones in the 90s / early 00s.
This is built for web browsers, and should work in mobile browsers fairly well.

Improvements (IMO) from Adam's version:
- Apples cannot spawn where there is already an apple or snake part.
- There is a button to restart the game when the game is over.
- works in Safari on Mac (there were issues getting the Game Over! text to appear.
- Added touch/click buttons for mobile
- removed up/down key event listeners in order to stay true to 2D...you must become one with the snake!
- after 10 points, gets faster at every point. This might be a place to change this to get faster every 5 points or so.

Enjoy!
